# Paninerd Discord bot

## Description

This is a bot deployed on a discord channel just to have fun and learn bots and javascript. It uses [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## How to run it

Clone the repo on your computer and run `npm init` to install all packages. You will need the `config.json` file which is hidden due to security issues. (Don't want to give it's token...).
